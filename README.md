This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It serves as a digital resume to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. The website includes sections such as:

About Me: An introduction to who I am, my background, and professional journey.
Projects: A collection of the projects I've worked on, with links to live demos and detailed descriptions.
Contact: A simple way for visitors to reach out and connect with me.
The website is designed with a responsive layout, ensuring it works seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
